You agree that you are above 18 years of age, and you agree that if there is an issue with a form of discipline that has been handed to you, you will appeal it, rather than arguing about it with Staff or other members. Lastly, you agree to report the misconduct to a staff member immediately if you see people not following the rules, whether in DM or in the server. \u2022 Last Update:2\/2\/2021"
